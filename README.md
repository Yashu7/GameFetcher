# GameFetcher

Desktop app written in WPF (MVVM pattern)

Curate your personal database of games. Choose which platform you are playing, give scores and keep track of release dates.

Uses external IGDB API for searching.

I implemented API connection to my WebApi project (https://github.com/Yashu7/WebCrawlerAPI) which tells if particular Nintendo Switch games are on sale but it's offline at the moment. 

WHAT YOU NEED:
.NET Framework 4.7.2
